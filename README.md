# Node push notification sample

A small web push notification sample, built following the tutorial [Push Notifications Using Node.js & Service Worker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlYFW2zaYQM) by [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy).

# To run locally

- Environment: You will need a VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY and a VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY. Check the tutorial to see how to generate them. I also created an environments.js file for the frontend to keep the keys secret. Check comments in client.js.

Then:

- `npm i`
- `npm run start`

# To do

- The sample still gives some errors, which hopefully I will be able to correct, but for the main purpose it works.
